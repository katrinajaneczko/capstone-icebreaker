DESCRIPTION:The Software Development Plan outlines the activities and tasks to be performed to develop a software product. It includes a list of activities\, such as requirements gathering and testing\, and tasks with predecessor and successor tasks\, estimated effort\, and responsible individuals. It also includes a schedule in the form of a Gantt chart and a description of the development environment\, including the hardware and software to be used. The plan should also outline the version control tool and procedures to be used to maintain a defined main branch of the project.

DESCRIPTION:The Requirements Specification is a design document that outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for a project. It serves as a contract between the project team and stakeholders and will be used to measure the project's success or failure. The specification should include an overview of the system and its block diagram\, a general overview of the document\, a list of general requirements\, a description of features and requirements\, and use-case or user story descriptions with triggering events and interactions between the actor and the system. Normal and alternate flows should also be described\, and external interfaces with the user and external hardware or software should be identified.

Finally\, it includes acceptance tests\, which demonstrate all functional and non-functional requirements through a combination of automated tests derived from use-cases and manual tests with recorded observations of the results.
