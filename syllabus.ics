DESCRIPTION:The Test Procedures document describes the approach and tests to be performed to verify the requirements specified in the Requirements Document. It includes procedures for unit tests\, which involve testing individual methods with input parameter values and expected results\, using mock objects to stub external classes. It also includes integration tests\, which demonstrate each use-case based on the use-case descriptions and sequence diagrams\, using mock objects for external input and verification. Finally\, it includes acceptance tests\, which demonstrate all functional and non-functional requirements through a combination of automated tests derived from use-cases and manual tests with recorded observations of the results.

DESCRIPTION:The Project Proposal provides an overview of a project's goals and describes its top-level requirements\, conceptual design\, and comparison to similar products. It should include a project abstract that is at least half a page long and should not contain personal statements about the project's development. The proposal should also include a description of the project's background and a list of required resources for its development. The project abstract will be featured on the project's development webpage and repeated as the introduction to all other project documents. An optional project logo should not be more than 32 pixels high and 128 pixels wide. Proper citation of sources is required in the background section.
